\subsection{Idea}
\begin{frame}{The early days}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Humans know what is good for them
        \item Humans create Websites
        \item Humans will only \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink}{link} to Websites they like
        \item[$\Rightarrow$] Hyperlinks are a quality indicator
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How could we use that?}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Simply count number of links to a Website
        \item[\xmark] 10,000 links from only one page
        \item Count numbers of Websites that link to a Website
        \item[\xmark] Quality of the page matters
        \item[\xmark] Total number of links on the source page matters
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
