This is a short presentation for the "Tutorenprogramm - Start in die

KIT-Style
---------
I am not allowed to add the KIT-Style files to this public repository.
So if you want the KIT-Style, you have to add those files by
yourself to the "templates" folder:
 * beamercolorthemekit.sty
 * beamerthemekit.sty
 * example.bib
 * tikzkit.sty
 * beamerthemekitbase.sty: change `\titleimage{...}` to your needs
 * beamerthemekitwide.sty
 * semirounded.sty
 * tikzuml.sty

and the following files to the "logos" folder:
 * kitlogo_de_rgb.eps
 * your `titleimage`
