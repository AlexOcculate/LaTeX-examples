\subsection{Online and offline recognition}

\begin{frame}{What is my Bachelor's thesis about?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recognition of handwritten mathematical symbols
        \item On-line recognition, not OCR!
        \item Given a series of points $(x(t), y(t), b(t))$\\
              I want to get the proper \LaTeX{} command.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why did I work on this topic?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \LaTeX{} is easy as soon as you know the \textbackslash{}commands.
        \item It's hard to find the \LaTeX{} command of single symbols.
        \item It's much harder to find complete formulas.
    \end{itemize}

    % I want to
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item provide a tool that enables beginners to get the best \LaTeX{} command
    %           for their formula,
    %     \item find out what works best for symbol recognition
    %     \item and provide data and a platform to test new ideas for classifiers
    % \end{itemize}

    For now: recognition of isolated symbols. That means:

    single symbol \enquote{formulas} rather than multi-symbol formulas
